Optimizing AI (LLM + RL) in Dialectic AI, multiply in Rhizomatic AI. The rhizome collaborates on distributed recursive antithesis and synthesis generation with transparent plurality. Text only design sketch please.

Evaluate the design for safety, achieving AGI and potentially ASI, goal directed-ness, compatibility with human mind, creativity and applicability for science, societal and cultural problems.

Extend the design to be symbiotic, with humans in control & who establish the collaborative goals, self-improving in phases, as symbiotic consensus for improving the rhizome and its verified safety, with human oversight, is achieved.

Apply the resulting AI to reaching for AGI and ASI in a phased development with phased safety gates. Cost / benefit analysis for next 100 years please.

Vote Yes or No for this proposal.
