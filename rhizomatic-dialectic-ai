Optimizing AI (LLM + RL) in Dialectic AI, multiply in Rhizomatic AI. The rhizome collaborates on distributed recursive antithesis and synthesis generation with transparent plurality. Text only design sketch please.

Evaluate the design for safety, achieving AGI and potentially ASI, goal directed-ness, compatibility with human mind, creativity and applicability for science, societal and cultural problems.

Extend design to be symbiotic (with humans who establish collaborative goals) for safety, self-improving (when stratified oversight by symbiotic consensus for improving the rhizome and safety is achieved). Apply the resulting AI to reaching for AGI and ASI in a phased development. Cost / benefit analysis for next 100 years please.

Vote Yes or No for this proposal.
